# Retro 65C02 board toolchain (WIP)

This project contains an assembler for the 65C02 8 bit CPU, written in Rust.
I use this assembler to create programs for the [retro 6502 board I recently
crafted](https://github.com/ulmer-a/board6502).

I eventually want to create a compiler that uses this assembler to translate
a simple language into 6502 machine code.
